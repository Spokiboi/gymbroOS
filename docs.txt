DOCS FOR GYMBRO OS

To move the square, you use the arrow keys. You can place nodes with the respective number on the keyboard.
To erease a node it is space. To delete all your progress is D. To save your progress its P. To load a file (stored in browser), you press L.
Formulate your file when loading file like: /gmb/filename.gmb

The counter on the left can be manipulated
Cell 4 is the unicode of cell 3 + 22. (starts at null, goes up)
To increment a cell you have to make the little number in the top right be on the correct list item.
Increment or decrement counter number to change that number.
To increment or decrement the current counter, you use the required nodes for that.
The counter is used with commands, which are the cyan nodes.
It takes counter 1, and uses it to find what command to execute.
It may also use counter 2 to assist. Here is a list:
 - cmd 1: if it comes from a specific side, it spits out another side. Used for loops.
     - counter2 = 1 if pointer comes from left, go up else keep going
     - counter2 = 2 if pointer comes from top, go right else keep going
     - counter2 = 3 if pointer comes from right, go down else keep going
     - counter2 = 4 if pointer comes from bottom, go left else keep going
- cmd 2: add counter4 to counter5, used for typing.
- cmd 3: replace the counter which is mentioned in counter2 with 0. (if counter2 was 7, counter7 would now be 0)

The pointer is a fundamental piece of the puzzle, it moves along from the top left, and follows your path.
Every node moves it, but some do special things with it. The wire node only moves it without side effects.
It can be turnt and looped and moved using the nodes.
Whenever the pointer lands on a node, it activates the node, doing the action which is described.

Booleans are used to get user input, at default it is key right. You can switch this with the light green node.
It goess around the arrows like:
   - Right (starting point)
   - Down
   - Left
   - Up
   - back to first

It seems easier than it is (it doesnt seem easy)
